## Introduction
I am a sixth year student in the doctoral program in political science here at UC. Broadly speaking, my research interests focus on American politics. More specifically, I'm motivated by understanding how intragroup dynamics drive public opinion formation of Latinxs. To that end, my dissertation project is working to assess the consequences that emotions have in the making of Latinx identity and their subsequent linkages to patterns of policy preferences and vote choice. 

I'm also interested in the consequences of politicization on national institutions and policy. In this vein, I have ongoing research projects that include:

1. Renaming and Credit Claiming in Federal Agencies: The Effects of Partisanship on Organizational Design

2. Limiting Dreams: The Politics of Refugee Caps

I also have research that has appeared in or is forthcoming in *Journal of Borderlands Studies* and *Communication Studies*. This course is part of my journey to earning a Graduate Certificate in Computational Social Science.
