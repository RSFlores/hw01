**Repository for Homework 01**

This is the repository of Richard Flores. I am excited to learn the ropes on [Github!](http://github.com)

##Introduction
I am a sixth year student in the doctoral program in political science here at UC. Broadly speaking, my research interests focus on American politics. More specifically, I'm motivated by understanding how intragroup dynamics drive public opinion formation of Latinxs. To that end, my dissertation project is working to assess the consequences that emotions have in the making of Latinx identity and their subsequent linkages to patterns of policy preferences and vote choice. 

I'm also interested in the consequences of politicization on national institutions and policy. In this vein, I have ongoing research projects that include:

1. Renaming and Credit Claiming in Federal Agencies: The Effects of Partisanship on Organizational Design

2. Limiting Dreams: The Politics of Refugee Caps

I also have research that has appeared in or is forthcoming in *Journal of Borderlands Studies* and *Communication Studies*. This course is part of my journey to earning a Graduate Certificate in Computational Social Science.

##Reflections
In this section, I describe how I got the changes into README.md before turning to reflect on my GitHub workflow and Markdown experience. I was able learn the fundamental for Markdown syntax from the GitHub [Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to mastering Markdown. The names of the journal titles are in italic with the use of a single asterisk at the beginning and end of the titles. The Repository for Homework 01 header is in bold with the use of two asterisks placed before Repository and after 01. 
I also learned how to add links with the github url (before the introduction) and the Github Guide to Markdown url (earlier in this section). These were accomplished by putting brackets between the word(s) that I wanted to place the url on. Then, I put the actual url in between parenthesis after the closed bracket. I learned how to use headers, which involved inserting the corresponding number of # for the tier of header that you want before the text itself. Lastly, I made an ordered list by following the proper spacing and number ordering (1,2) in my brief description of ongoing work.

###GitHub
My GitHub workflow follows the same principles outlined in the [guidelines](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/faq/homework-guidelines/#homework-workflow). First, I forked the repository from the class page. After cloning the repo to my laptop, I've worked from RStudio to modify the README.md. I will then commit the changes locally,before pushing them up to my GitHub page, and create a pull request. Before pushing changes, it is important to pull first so that you don't accidentally override anything that's been put in the repo since your last pull.

###Markdown
I have been pleasantly surprised with Markdown so far. The learning curve is not as steep as I thought, and it's nice to begin learning a text formatting language that is an important and relevant part of modern research and more general collaboration efforts. I wish there was an active spell check, though (but this might be strictly preferable given that Word all too often autocorrects text incorrectly).
